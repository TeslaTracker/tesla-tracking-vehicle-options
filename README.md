Tracking of the various vehicle options using the image api
Thanks to /u/KemmeyReddit from this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gtptpd/tesla_api_to_image/fsej0hi/) for the inspiration !

Each option is associated with an internal code

This code is referenced in both the configurator (with a $ prefix) and the image API (see example link above)
